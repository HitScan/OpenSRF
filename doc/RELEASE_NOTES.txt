Release notes for OpenSRF 2.1.0
===============================

Supported platforms
-------------------
The following Linux distributions are supported:

  * Debian 6 (Squeeze)
  * Fedora 16, 17
  * Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Karmic Koala), 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin)

The following platforms are *no longer* supported:

  * CentOS 5
  * Debian 5 (Lenny)
  * Fedora 14 and 15
  * RHEL 5

New features
------------

OpenSRF Validator service (`opensrf.validator`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The new `opensrf.validator` service offers a home for common validation
routines. It includes two validators for email addresses:

  * OpenSRF::Application::Validator::EmailAddress::Regex - validates an email
    address using a basic regular expression
  * OpenSRF::Application::Validator::EmailAddress::DNS - validates the domain
    of an email address

Ingress tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To provide more granular logging of OpenSRF activity, the 'ingress' (or 'entry
point') for an OpenSRF client can now be tracked. The default value of the
`ingress` property is `opensrf`, but other likely values include `srfsh`,
`translator-v1`, and `gateway-v1`.

Java HTTP gateway client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Support has been added to the Java OpenSRF libraries for communicating with the
OpenSRF HTTP gateway via the `org.opensrf.net.http` package.

Example Nagios plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An example Nagios plugin that checks every defined service for a brick for a
response has been added at `examples/nagios/check_osrf_services`.

Log warnings for large XMPP messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As ejabberd disconnects clients when sending very large messages, write a log
message when the XMPP message will exceed the default threshold of 1,800,000
bytes. This threshold can be modified via the `<msg_size_warn>` element in
the `opensrf_core.xml` configuration file.

Documentation improvements
--------------------------
The `INSTALL` file in the root directory is now the canonical guide to
installing and configuring OpenSRF.

Build improvements
------------------
The source directory is now bootstrapped via the standard `autoreconf -i`
autotools command, rather than the old `autogen.sh` command.

Dependencies for OpenSRF's Java libraries have been updated to reflect modern
Java.

The `DESTDIR` variable is respected at build time to better support distribution
packaging efforts.
 
Testing
-------
The new `make check` target will run all unit tests across C, Perl, and Python.

Unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~
Various unit tests have been added to Python

Continuous integration support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An example configuration file for the http://buildbot.net/[Buildbot] continuous
integration server can be found in `examples/buildbot.cfg`. The most current
version of this file will always be found in the `master` branch of the OpenSRF
git repository.

The build steps configure and compile the code using the default arguments to
`configure`, as well as running the unit tests for C, Perl, and Python, and
running `pylint` against the Python source code.
