    LP#1684970 Translator compatible with mod_remoteip
    
    Teach the OSRF Translator to request the IP address of the user agent
    (e.g. web browser) instead of the IP address of the up stream client,
    which may be a proxy, using the Apache 2.4 request_rec->useragent_ip
    value.
    
    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/developer/new_api_2_4.html
    
    This make is possible for the translator to access the client IP with
    Apache's mod_remoteip enabled and configured.
    
    Includes sample config and install documentation.

    LP#1776510 JS libs handle transport errors
    
    Teach the websocket client code to look for the transport_error flag
    applied to the websocket wrapper message by the websocket gateway when a
    request for an unavilable service is made.
    
    When encountered, fire the transport or generic error handler callbacks,
    if available.  Avoid any attempts to further process the message.

    LP#1702978: memcache Get methods use key as va_list format
    
    And, when a key (composed of, say, a username or barcode) has a % in it,
    bad things happen.  We will stop acting as if these are variadic functions
    now, and also update Evergreen so that it does not do that either.
    
    TODO: Make these actually non-variadic, but that breaks ABI.
