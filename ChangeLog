Changes for the 1.2.3 release:

2010-10-15  dbs

	* README, src/perl/lib/OpenSRF.pm: Update to version 1.2.3; remove Intrepid from
	  supported distros list

2010-10-12  erickson

	* src/javascript/opensrf.js: when we add xhr responses onto the end of the queue,
	  stash the original session as well, otherwise we're attempting to ask a session
	  questions about requests it's not tracking

2010-08-18  erickson

	* src/javascript/opensrf.js: back-port 2008: async message handling ordering

2010-04-15  dbs

	* src/extras/Makefile.install: Install DateTime packages rather than relying on
	  CPAN
	  
	  etch and hardy have all but DateTime::Format::ISO8601 packaged;
	  if we don't install the DateTime packages, D:F:ISO8601 forces a CPAN
	  install - and building current versions of DateTime appears to be problematic
	  on Hardy, at least
	  
	  We were installing these packages as prereqs in the Evergreen Makefile.install,
	  so this problem might stem all the way back to the split of the Evergreen and
	  OpenSRF dependency installers.

2010-03-12  miker

	* src/perl/lib/OpenSRF/Utils.pm: backport spelling fix alias to reduce pain in
	  backporting

Changes for the 1.2.2 release:

2010-02-03  dbs

	* src/javascript/opensrf_xhr.js: Prevent Internet Explorer from
	  making multipart-mixed-replace calls as well

Changes for the 1.2.1 release:

2009-11-20  dbs

	* [r1859] Patch from Jeroen van Meeuwen (Fedora Project)
	  <kanarip@fedoraproject.org> to use $(APXS2)
	  
	  Attached patch makes the auto foo respect the --with-apxs
	  ./configure option for src/gateway/Makefile.am.

	* [r1860] Backport Ubuntu Karmic prereq install target to 1.2
	  branch

	* [r1861] Merge Bill Erickson's fixes (r1730, r1731) from trunk for
	  recent versions of ejabberd
	  
	  Set the 'from' address in outbound xmpp messages

2009-12-02  erickson

	* [r1866] Prevent infinite loop (with logging) in child process
	  reaping.
	  
	  From the perl docs on waitpid:
	  
	  Note that on some systems, a return value of "-1" could mean that
	  child processes are being automatically reaped. See perlipc for
	  details, and for other examples.

2010-01-25  erickson

	* [r1902] Added some fault tolerance to the inbound-to-unixserver
	  message handoff process. In some conditions, the unix socket will
	  result in sigpipe (anecdotally, seen more oftenvirtualized
	  environments). these changes add a call to select before writing
	  to the socket to check for socket availability and add a sigpipe
	  handler that forces the inbound process to wait a brief period of
	  time before trying the delivery again

	* [r1907] Apply patches for enhancing portability, from Dan
	  McMahill
	  
	  The following is a list of the patches and a brief description of
	  what they are supposed to address. They were needed for building
	  OpenSRF-1.2.0 (the most recent release) on a NetBSD system.
	  
	  patch-aa -- some systems have dlerror() in libc instead of libdl
	  so use AC_SEARCH_LIBS to see if we need an explicit -ldl or not.
	  Fail in the same way as the previous code if we can't find
	  dlerror() anywhere.
	  
	  malloc_stats() is malloc implementation specific so check for it
	  and define HAVE_MALLOC_STATS if we do.
	  
	  patch-ab -- No need to explicitly list -lxml2 -ldl -lmemcache in
	  LDADD. These were automatically filled in via the LIBS variable
	  which is filled in via AC_SEARCH_LIBS and AC_CHECK_LIB. Also this
	  way -ldl only shows up if it is actually needed.
	  
	  patch-ac -- Only conditionally call malloc_stats() if it exists.
	  On systems without malloc_stats(), just print a warning to the
	  effect.
	  
	  patch-ad -- Instead of using -lopensrf for foo_la_LIBADD use
	  @top_builddir@/src/libopensrf/libopensrf.la. This is the way to
	  link to the not-yet-installed libtool library we just built.
	  
	  patch-af -- "sed -i" is a GNU sed extension and not portable to
	  Solaris or the various BSDs. Rework the target a little to be
	  more portable.
	  
	  patch-ag -- Use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash. And to make sure
	  this will work on non-Linux systems where /bin/sh is *not* bash,
	  make things a little more portable. The biggest is that function
	  foo { code here } is replaced by the more portable foo() {code
	  here} syntax.
	  
	  patch-ah -- Use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash. And to make sure
	  this will work on non-Linux systems where /bin/sh is *not* bash,
	  make things a little more portable. Of note, "echo -e" is
	  non-portable so instead use as "here document" which is more
	  portable and also I think easier to edit anyway. Also address the
	  function syntax and finally "==" is a bash extension to "test".
	  "=" does the same thing and is portable to other shells.

	* [r1908] Apply one more portability patch from Dan McMahill
	  
	  patch-ae -- $$(command) is ok with bash and ksh but is not
	  portable to all /bin/sh implementations. Also instead of hard
	  coding "apxs2" use the APXS2 variable which was set during the
	  configure process. This is especially helpful when the binary is
	  installed as apxs instead of apxs2.
	  
	  Finally, remove the DEF_LDLIBS from the apxs2 compilation/link
	  line. As near as I can tell this only removed -lopensrf which is
	  ok because we already had libopensrf.so explicitly listed.
	  Including -lopensrf didn't work correctly since libopensrf had
	  been built but not yet installed.
