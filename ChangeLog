    LP#1717350: fix chunking messages sent from Perl services
    
    The chunk size adjustments introduced by the patches for bug 1709710
    could result in calculating non-integral chunk sizes for Perl services.
    This in turn led to fractional offsets and lengths being passed to
    Perl's substr() function; rounding in turn can lead to characters
    in the response getting silently dropped, which in turn broke
    parsing the reconstituted response.
    
    To test
    -------
    The problem can be reproduced by invoking
    
      open-ils.storage open-ils.storage.actor.org_unit.descendants.atomic 1, 0
    
    in Evergreen databases with org unit trees large enough that the
    response gets chunked.
