    We also cleanup the while block nested in a do while block around line
    63 of osrf_cache.c to be more readable by adding braces and breaking
    it across 3 lines.

    LP#1243841 - Quiet wrong format warnings during make install.
    
    During make install, the compiler warns that %d expects an int when the
    actual value is a long int.  Changing %d to %ld fixes the issue.

    Referring to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5476759/compiler-warning-suggest-parentheses-around-assignment-used-as-truth-value,
    it is recommended to wrap variable assignments that are used as a truth
    test within an extra set of parentheses.

    LP1340982: Ignore both 'comment' and '#comment' nodes in Settings Parse.
    
    Modify the XML2perl helper function in OpenSRF::Utils::SettingsParser
    to ignore comment nodes that have names of comment and #comment.
    
    To reproduce the bug:
    
    1. Stop OpenSRF services.
    
    2. Add a XML comment, any text betwen <!-- and -->, in the list of
    MARC templates in the opensrf.xml file.
    
    3. Restart OpenSRF services.
    
    4. In the staff client, go to Cataloging->Create New MARC Record.
    
    5. In the list of templates, you will #comment where you added the
    comment. (NOTE: I only tested with 1 comment.  Things may get worse
    with more than 1 comment.)
    
    6. There will be an error like the following in the
    open-ils.cat_stderr.log if you attempt to choose the #comment entry:
    
       Caught error from 'run' method: Exception: OpenSRF::EX::ERROR
       2018-02-18T11:24:30 OpenSRF::Application
       /usr/local/share/perl/5.22.1/OpenSRF/Application.pm:240 System
       ERROR: Unable to open MARC template file: HASH(0x2249928) :
    
    To test the fix:
    
    1. Leave the comments in the opensrf.xml file from before.
    
    2. Apply this commit, do make and make install for OpenSRF.
    
    3. Just to make sure, do make and make install for Evergreen.
    
    4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 from above.
    
    5. You should NOT see any templates named #comment.

    LP#1762815 Empty client TZ defaults to server TZ (Perl)
    
    Fixes an issue in the Perl client time zone handling that resulted in
    the server defaulting to UTC time instead of the server time zone when
    no time zone value was received from the client.

    LP#1744158 Websocket proc exits on ejabberd disconnect
    
    Any errors relaying websocket messages to OpenSRF now result in the WS
    client being disconnected, allowing the WS process to exit.  This
    prevents the WS gateway from accepting requests it cannot process and
    allows the client to connect to a new WS process.

    LP#1746577 Websocket responder exits on jabber disconnect
    
    Regularly check for Jabber socket disconnects in the websocket gateway
    "responder" thread (that relays messages from opensrf to the WS client)
    and force a client disconnect when a broken jabber socket is detected.
