    LP#1709710 Count Perl chunk/bundle sizes in bytes
    
    For the purposes of bundling/chunking, count the number of bytes in each
    affected string instead of the number of characters.
    
    See also https://perldoc.perl.org/bytes.html and 'perldoc -f length'

    LP#1709710: Make chunk sizing smart about XML quoting
    
    XML inside JSON as a quoted string that's itself inside XML causes quite the
    pile up of nested excaping of certain characters in OpenSRF PARTIAL_RESPONSE
    messages.  Here we check for the worst offenders (<, >, &, and ") and account
    for the cost of escaping them in chunked response stanzas.

    LP#1690206 - remove check of httpd.conf from OpenSRF Makefile.install
    
    The original src/extras/Makefile.install included a grep of the
    file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, which is no longer installed by default
    on supported Debian and Ubuntu releases.  As this check results in
    an error message, it makes sense to remove the check altogether.

    Confirm that a child process is alive just before attempting to write to
    its pipe.  If the child process is dead, log the error, then drop the
    message and move on.  This allows the parent to continue servicing
    future requests.

    LP#1711194: avoid division by zero errors
    
    Under some circumstances, osrf_control --diagnostic may not
    be able to deduce the correct max_children setting for a service,
    e.g., if it's run without --localhost on a system that doesn't
    have a opensrf.xml config section specifying active apps for a
    specific hostname. When that happens, just display the count
    of running drones rather than displaying error messages about
    undefined $dmax values and divisions by zero.

    LP#1711194 osrf_config --diagnostic reports max-children
    
    --diagnostic output shows the maximum number of allowed drones per
    service along with the active drone count.  Additionally, a usage
    percentage value is displayed.
    
    E.g.
    
    $ /openils/bin/osrf_control -l --diagnostic
    
    * open-ils.acq   [1581] uptime=00:35 cputime=00:00:00 #drones=1/15 6%

    LP#1704116: fix intermittant failure of parallel building
    
    Running make to do a parallel build (e.g., 'make -j 4' or
    the like) could fail because of an undeclared dependency; this
    patch fixes the issue.
    
    The issue can be reproduced by repeating "make clean; make -j 4"
    until the build fails.
