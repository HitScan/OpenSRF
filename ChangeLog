    LP#1631522: Dispatch mode for method_lookup subrequests
    
    There is a pattern in the wild of using OpenSRF's method_lookup() facility
    to decide between one of several local methods when delegating to pre-existing
    logic.  Often times, we want to simply hand control over to another method,
    but the output of a subrequest's run() is an array of results.  The caller has
    to know if, and how, to restructure the result for the client.
    
    Instead, we can now call dispatch() instead of run() and have OpenSRF session
    control completely passed to the delegate code.  This way, the delegate code
    need not know anything about its caller, and vice versa.

    LP#1612771: bundling and chunking
    
    This patch is first in a series of patches that provides the following
    features:
    
    * OpenSRF message bundling -- Pack multiple OpenSRF messages together
    in a single XMPP envelope, as long as we believe more messages will be
    sent in the future and we are below some threshold of combined message size.
    The default for that threshold is 25Kb.
    
     * OpenSRF message chunking -- Break up large OpenSRF messages across
    multiple XMPP envelopes. This is implemented with a new OpenSRF message type.
    C, Perl, and Javascript libraries are taught how to reconstruct chunked
    messages. The default chunking threshold is 50Kb, just a bit below the default
    ejabberd max stanza size of 64Kb.
    
    This patch in particular renames "chunking" to "bundling", then
    implements message splitting ("chunking") in Perl using two new
    oilsResult subclasses

    LP#1631520: configure install location of Perl modules
    
    Add --with-perlbase configure option to specify
    an alternative location for installing the Perl modules. This
    can be useful for setups that want to run the Perl modules
    from a shared filesystem or environments that need to run
    multiple versions of OpenSRF simultaneously.
    
    Users of --with-perlbase are responsible for ensuring that
    PERL5LIB is set appropriately.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Use --with-perlbase during the configure step, e.g.,
    
        ./configure --perl-base /tmp/perl
    
    [2] Run make; make check; sudo make install
    [3] Verify that the Perl modules are installed under
        /tmp/perl.
    [4] Make a change to a Perl source file, then
        go to src/perl, then run sudo ./Build install. Verify
        that it remembers the --with-perlbase directory
        and installs the updated module there.

    LP#1485371: Use client-supplied TZ
    
    Currently, there is no protocol-level mechanism for passing the client's
    desired timezone to the server. In much the same way we pass the locale,
    we can let the server know what timezone it should use when interpreting
    time stamps.
    
    To do this we:
    
     * Teach perl server code to live in the client TZ, if supplied
     * Teach perl client code to send the current $ENV{TZ}
     * Teach javascript library to include client TZ in
       gateway/translator/websocket communication
     * Teach C code to pull the incoming TZ and apply it to outgoing messages
     * Teach srfsh to pull TZ from the environment and pass it with requests

    LP#1559121: remove Debian Squeeze support
    
    Now that Debian Squeeze's LTS (long-term support) period
    has ended, Evergreen no longer offers community support
    for that distribution. This patch removes references
    to Squeeze from the installation scripts and documentation.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Verify that Debian Squeeze is no longer referenced in
        the installation documentation.

    LP#1350457: Pass caller's session to subrequests called via method_lookup
    
    In the process of looking up a method for an internal subrequest, we lose
    session info. This is a problem when the subrequest makes a remote request,
    because then the subrequest can't look up the proper locale, among other
    things. The forthcoming branch passes the caller's session to the subrequest.
    
    This patch also teaches OpenSRF object registration how to strip certain
    object members -- in particular, the session -- so that introspection
    continues to work.

    LP#1494486: Limit damage caused by dropped drone XMPP sockets
    
    It is apparently possible for drones to get into a state where their XMPP
    socket is closed but they don't notice. This is bad because the drone can
    continue to receive requests from its listener but can no longer respond
    to them. To limit the pain this can cause, we should kill the drone as soon
    as we notice this condition.
    
    To avoid overhead, this commit notices when the socket returns an error (or
    raises a signal, in Perl) upon write, and exits immediately.  One message
    will be lost, but the drone will no longer be a black hole that does nothing
    but absorb requests it can never fill.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Start an OpenSRF stack and look for a drone process.
    [2] Use lsof to identify which socket that drone is using
        to talk to XMPP.
    [3] Use gdb to attach to the process and close the socket, e.g.,
    
        $ gdb -p $PID
        (gdb) p close(11) # or whatever the socket number was
        (gdb) c
    
    [4] Use srfsh to make requests of that service. Eventually, one
        of them will hit the drone.
    [5] Sans patch, the request will get handled by the drone, but
        the results will never get sent, and the drone will remain
        available to handle other requests.
    [6] With the patch, the drone will exit when it discovers that it
        can no longer write to the XMPP socket.
