README for OpenSRF 1.0 RC

Installing prerequisites:
========================

OpenSRF has a number of prerequisite packages that must be installed
before you can successfully configure, compile, and install OpenSRF.
On Debian and Ubuntu, the easiest way to install these prerequisites
is to use the Makefile.install prerequisite installer for Evergreen.

Issue the following commands as the root user to install prerequisites
using the Makefile.install prerequisite installer, substituting "debian"
or "ubuntu" for <osname> below:

aptitude install wget make
wget http://svn.open-ils.org/trac/ILS/export/10741/trunk/Open-ILS/src/extras/Makefile.install
make -f Makefile.install <osname>

Note: You may also be able to use "centos" to install the OpenSRF
prerequisites for CentOS 5 and RHEL 5, or "gentoo" for Gentoo - but
these are less tested distributions. Your patches and suggestions for
improvement are welcome!

Configuration and compilation instructions:
==========================================

For the time being, we are still installing everything in the /openils/
directory (with the exception of the Perl modules, which are installed
into system directories). Issue the following commands to configure and
build OpenSRF:

./configure --prefix=/openils --sysconfdir=/openils/conf
make

Installation instructions:
=========================

Once you have configured and compiled OpenSRF, issue the following
command as the root user to install OpenSRF:

make install

This will install OpenSRF, including example configuration files in
/openils/conf/ that you can use as templates for your own configuration files.
